### **Technical Risk Scanning**

In the technical risk scanning stage, we assess potential technological challenges that could impact the project’s success. For your FYP, the technical risks could include:

- **Integration Issues**: If you're combining multiple technologies (e.g., APIs, databases, mobile app frameworks), there could be compatibility issues or delays in data flow between systems.
- **Scalability**: If the solution is meant to scale (e.g., for a large number of users), scalability issues might arise, such as slow performance, server downtimes, or inefficient algorithms.
- **Data Security**: Especially if you're handling sensitive data (personal information, payment information), there could be risks around protecting that data.
- **Dependencies on Third-Party Tools**: If your project relies on third-party services or APIs (e.g., cloud services, data processing APIs), issues with their stability or cost could impact the project.

### **Ethical Risk Scanning**

Ethical considerations in a project should be part of the development process, ensuring that the system does not cause harm or benefit a select few at the cost of others. For your project, ethical risks could include:

- **Data Privacy and Confidentiality**: If you're handling personal or sensitive data, ensure that users' privacy is maintained. This includes consent for data collection, storage, and sharing.
- **Bias**: If your system involves AI or automated decision-making, you need to ensure that it doesn’t introduce bias in decision-making (e.g., favoring certain groups over others).
- **Accessibility**: The system should be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. If it’s not, it could unintentionally exclude certain groups.
- **Transparency**: If your system involves complex algorithms or machine learning, the decision-making process should be understandable and transparent to the users.

### **Technical and Ethical Pre-Mortem**

In this pre-mortem phase, you need to assume that the project has failed, and then analyze where human/organizational failures could occur:

1. **Human Failure Points**:
    
    - **Lack of Communication**: If team members (or stakeholders) don’t communicate effectively, it could lead to a misunderstanding of requirements or missed deadlines.
    - **Skill Gaps**: If the project demands expertise that the team doesn’t have, this could cause delays or issues with technical execution.
    - **Neglecting User Needs**: Focusing too much on the technology and ignoring the actual users' needs (e.g., usability) could lead to a solution that’s technically sound but not practically usable.
2. **Organizational Failure Points**:
    
    - **Resource Management**: Insufficient resources (time, money, personnel) could prevent the project from reaching its full potential.
    - **Lack of Stakeholder Engagement**: If stakeholders (e.g., users, clients) are not involved regularly, their changing needs may not be addressed in the project.
    - **Inadequate Testing/Feedback Loops**: Not having enough testing phases or failing to incorporate feedback may lead to unforeseen issues at later stages.

**Prevention Strategies**:

- Set clear communication protocols.
- Assign resources carefully and ensure team members are skilled in the necessary technologies.
- Regularly gather feedback from users and stakeholders throughout the development process.

### **OBE - Design & Development of Solutions**

This stage ensures that the design and development are aligned with the learning objectives. To assess whether any issues identified in risk scanning might become binding constraints:

- **Time Constraints**: If there are technical or ethical issues that take more time to resolve, they may delay your project timeline and prevent the final solution from being developed on schedule.
- **Budget Constraints**: Ethical and technical challenges might require additional resources, which could cause the budget to exceed expectations.
- **Scalability Constraints**: If scalability was not adequately considered during design, it could prevent the solution from being effective in the real world once it’s deployed.

To ensure the project progresses smoothly, take steps to mitigate identified risks in the early stages of development.

### **Prototyping - Build**

#### **OBE - Ethics: Remember the Ethical Benefits of Creative Work**

At this stage, you should ensure that the prototype still aligns with the intended ethical benefits outlined earlier. Ethical benefits include:

- **User Empowerment**: Ensure that the prototype empowers users by enhancing their capabilities or solving real-world problems.
- **Social Impact**: Consider how the prototype will benefit society—whether it addresses important issues like education, accessibility, or environmental sustainability.
- **Privacy and Security**: Confirm that all the ethical measures (e.g., data privacy and transparency) are integrated into the prototype to maintain user trust.

#### **Expanding the Circle: Is There Anyone This Prototype Won't Work For?**

A thorough assessment of your prototype should also consider any limitations or groups it may not serve effectively. These could include:

- **People with Disabilities**: If the prototype does not follow accessibility guidelines, it might not work for people with visual, hearing, or cognitive impairments.
- **Technological Access**: Users without access to modern technology (e.g., smartphones, fast internet) might not be able to use the prototype effectively.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: The design or functionality might unintentionally exclude certain cultural or social groups. For example, language or interface design may not cater to all users, or certain features may inadvertently offend specific groups.

**Mitigation**:

- Ensure compliance with accessibility guidelines (WCAG).
- Offer alternative methods for users with limited technology access.
- Conduct user research with diverse groups to identify any possible exclusions early on.

# **OBE (Outcome-Based Education) for Final Year Project**

## **1. Technical Risk Scanning**

In this phase, the primary focus is to identify and assess potential technical challenges that could impact the success of the project. The following technical risks have been identified:

- **Integration Issues**: Given the multiple technologies involved in the project (e.g., APIs, databases, mobile app frameworks), integration problems could arise. These issues may lead to delays or data flow incompatibility between systems.
- **Scalability**: As the project may need to scale for a large number of users, scalability could become a concern, including performance bottlenecks, server downtimes, or inefficient algorithms.
- **Data Security**: Since sensitive user data (e.g., personal or financial information) might be involved, there is a risk around ensuring the security of such data during storage and transfer.
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: The project may depend on external services (cloud services, APIs, etc.), which could experience instability or cost issues affecting the project’s outcome.

## **2. Ethical Risk Scanning**

Ethical considerations are central to ensuring the system does not harm users or the broader community. The key ethical risks identified include:

- **Data Privacy and Confidentiality**: The project must ensure that user data is handled responsibly. This includes obtaining informed consent for data collection, clear data storage policies, and stringent measures to protect the privacy of the users.
- **Bias**: If the system involves machine learning or automated decision-making, it is crucial to ensure there is no bias in the system's operation, particularly with regard to race, gender, or socioeconomic status.
- **Accessibility**: The system must be usable by individuals with disabilities. If not, it could unintentionally exclude certain users, violating inclusivity standards.
- **Transparency**: The decision-making process, particularly when algorithms or AI are involved, must be understandable to users, ensuring transparency in the actions taken by the system.

## **3. Technical and Ethical Pre-Mortem**

A pre-mortem involves assuming that the project has failed and analyzing the potential human and organizational failures that could have led to this outcome:

### **Human Failure Points**:

- **Lack of Communication**: Miscommunication among team members, stakeholders, or users could lead to misunderstanding requirements or missing critical milestones.
- **Skill Gaps**: If there is a lack of required technical expertise within the team, it may hinder progress and lead to inefficiencies or incorrect implementation.
- **Neglecting User Needs**: If the user’s requirements are not continuously considered during the development phase, the end result may be a technically sound solution that is not practically usable.

### **Organizational Failure Points**:

- **Resource Management**: Insufficient resources (financial, personnel, or time) could limit the project’s ability to meet expectations or complete all phases of development.
- **Lack of Stakeholder Engagement**: If key stakeholders are not engaged regularly, changing requirements or expectations might not be addressed in the solution.
- **Inadequate Testing/Feedback Loops**: Failing to incorporate sufficient user feedback or comprehensive testing could lead to undetected issues when the solution is deployed.

### **Prevention Strategies**:

- Establish clear communication protocols and regular check-ins.
- Ensure team members possess the necessary skills or provide additional training as needed.
- Gather feedback from stakeholders and users continuously to align with their evolving needs.

## **4. OBE - Design & Development of Solutions**

The design and development stage must ensure that the identified technical and ethical risks are carefully considered to prevent them from becoming binding constraints. The following potential constraints have been identified:

- **Time Constraints**: If unresolved technical or ethical challenges require more time to address than anticipated, it may cause delays in development and hinder the project’s overall timeline.
- **Budget Constraints**: Addressing unforeseen ethical or technical issues may require additional financial resources, potentially exceeding the project’s allocated budget.
- **Scalability Constraints**: If scalability concerns were not properly addressed during the design phase, it could prevent the system from performing effectively in a real-world scenario.

By keeping these constraints in mind, it is essential to allocate sufficient resources, time, and effort to ensure a smooth design and development phase that can progress without major setbacks.

## **5. Prototyping - Build**

### **OBE - Ethics: Remember the Ethical Benefits of Creative Work**

As the prototype is developed, it is crucial to ensure that the project still delivers the ethical benefits originally envisioned. The following ethical benefits should remain central to the project’s goals:

- **User Empowerment**: The prototype should continue to empower users by providing them with meaningful and practical solutions to their problems.
- **Social Impact**: The project should aim to positively impact society, whether through improved accessibility, solving critical issues, or contributing to sustainability.
- **Privacy and Security**: The prototype must adhere to the ethical principles of maintaining user privacy and data security, ensuring that these values are not compromised during development.

### **Expanding the Circle: Is There Anyone This Prototype Won’t Work For?**

It is important to ensure that the prototype works for a broad range of users and doesn't unintentionally exclude specific groups. The following considerations must be evaluated:

- **People with Disabilities**: If the prototype doesn’t follow accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG), it could exclude individuals with disabilities, preventing them from using the system effectively.
- **Technological Access**: Some users may have limited access to modern technology (e.g., older smartphones or slower internet connections), which could affect the usability of the system for them.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: The design or functionality of the system may unintentionally alienate certain cultural or social groups. For example, if the system is language-dependent or culturally exclusive, it may limit its user base.

### **Mitigation Measures**:

- Ensure compliance with accessibility guidelines to accommodate users with disabilities.
- Provide alternatives for users with lower technological access, such as lower data usage or simplified versions of the prototype.
- Conduct user research involving diverse groups to ensure the prototype is culturally sensitive and broadly applicable.
