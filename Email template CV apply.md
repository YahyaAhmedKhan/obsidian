Hi,  
I hope this email finds you well. I saw your ad for an AI/ML position on LinkedIn and I wanted to express my interest.  
  
I'm a 7th semester CS student at IBA with a strong interest in Gen AI. I've worked with LLMs in an internship with Premed.pk and have also worked on other smaller projects related to AI and ML such as RAG with Langchain as well as making Image classification models using Tensorflow and Roboflow.  
  
I'm looking for any good opportunities that involve AI/ML work. I've attached my CV for your review. I'd love to hear back from you.  
  
Warm regards,

Yahya Ahmed Khan  
BSCS'25,
